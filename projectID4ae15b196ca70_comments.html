<HTML><BODY>After producing three English, a Tagalog, a Dutch, and a French translation of this work, we finally get to the Spanish original of this important work.

<p>Note that obtaining a Spanish copy isn't as easy as a quick search of world-cat might suggest. The original first edition is extremely rare, as it was privately printed in Germany by the author, and smuggled to the Philippines, where the Spanish authorities did everything in their power to suppress the book. Very few copies remain today. After the author was executed after a mock-trial, and the US took over the colony, the work was reprinted in Spain, however, often in abbreviated form (I might run such an abbreviated edition later, to establish what exactly was changed.) This edition claims to be complete, and is supplemented with numerous footnotes.
